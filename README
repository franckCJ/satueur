MyOS

Abstract
--------

To have a better knowledge of my computer, I try to build an OS. It will never
be a "production" OS or a commercial one, it is only to improve my knowledge of
computers.

Be careful
----------

A lot of error will happen during the project, here are some solution but this
list should be improve :

Cross-compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why `binutils` compilation fails?

I go through 2 errors. First, the configure line should be :
    $> ../configure --target=$TARGET --prefix="$PREFIX" --disable-nls --disable-werror

from the build directory.

Also, is TARGET_ALIAS doesn't exist, look at you C_INCLUDE_PATH. It should not
finish with `:`

Why `gcc` compilation fails?

Be careful, LIBRARY_PATH, C_INCLUDE_PATH and CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH should not be
set
